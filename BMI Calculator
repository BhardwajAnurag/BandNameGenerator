Day 3 Exercise 1
Calculates the BMI of an individual on the basis of their height and weight, doesn't consider age as of now. Maps the BMI to the weight range they stand in

height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))

bmi = round(weight / height ** 2) #round used to round off till 2 decimal points

if bmi < 18.5:
	print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and you are underweight")
elif bmi < 25:
	print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and you are normal weight")
elif bmi < 30:
	print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and you are slightly overweight")
elif bmi < 35:
	print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and you are obese")
else:
	print(f"Your bmi is {bmi} and you are clinically obese")	 

#In if elif else, python checks from top. If first condition is not met, then it moves to the next (elif), so it's fine if there is overlapping, because the initla few numbers are already considered, and they won't be considered again
