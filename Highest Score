Day 5 Exercise 2
Finding the max value in a list using for loop instead of the max() function

student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)


highest_score = 0
for score in student_scores:
	if score > highest_score:
		highest_score = score

print(f"The highest score is {highest_score}")
