Day 4 Exercise 1

import random
random_integer = random.randint(0,1)

#here random is a module created by python, which has a function called randint which helps us generate random integers, which we assigned to a variable and printed it

if random_integer == 1:
	print("Heads")
else:
	print("Tails")
